# 2001_projects
This is the repository of my 3D projects inspired by 2001: Space Odissey

I make this 3D render inspired by the monolyth scene in the moon of "2001: Space Odissey" film.

I use:
- Blender for 3D models
- Unreal Engine for the render
- Quixel Bridge on Unreal Engine for the texture and Adobe Substance Painter 3D for descent structure

My goal was to improve my ability on 3D modelling and learn how to export 3D model in the corret way, create a material with Blueprint and landscape tool on Unreal Engine.

In the future my goal is to create a VR version of this render on Unreal Engine.

I hope you appreciate my work, thank you!
